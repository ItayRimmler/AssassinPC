UNFINISHED PROJECT:

Was supposed to: Be a PC only version of Assassin. 

Still, it:
- Has improved my programming skills, Python skills and Pygame experience (learned a lot of new tools)
- Has taught me multithreading
- Made me research about MANY topics, such as: Multithreading, assembly, asynchronous programming, interpeted languages vs. compiled languages, multi core processing, and more (none of those were made up I swear)
